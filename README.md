# zoom_slider_IE11
Google Maps' Library 3.22 zoom slider substitute for IE11 

Google Maps API for Javascript has removed the zoom slider control in the new versions. Last version including this control is 3.21. 

This small JS library and the related CSS create the same kind of slider for IE11, using HTML5 standard range input control.
